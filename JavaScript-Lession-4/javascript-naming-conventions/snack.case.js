// ? Now we learning the programming naming conventions JavaScript has 3 types of naming conventions. There are Camel-Case, Snack-Case, and Pascal-Case.

// ? Right now we learning to the "Snack_Case" naming conventions ----------------------------------->

const My_Name = "Rakibul Rahman";
const My_Age = 18;
const My_Dream = "Software engineering";

const my_name = "Rakibul Rahman";
const my_age = 18;
const my_dream = "software engineering";

// ? So what we learn this example? we learn how to declare a variable with "Snack_Case". remember that the "Snack_Case" always start the capital letter and the later words also start capital letter but when we declare two words we want add underscore (_).

// ! note:
// ! What is Snake Case?
// ? Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words.

// ? Here are some examples of snake case: first_name and last_name.
